After a surprise success with Easy Rider, Hopper got creative control to make a new film.
But what he created left him exiled from Hollywood for the next 7 years.
The Last Movie deals with the aftermath of a film production in Peru, where it follows the life of the horse wrangler Kansas (played by Hopper himself) when he chooses to stay behind in Peru.
Because of the postmodern nature of the film we will accompany the screening with a small lecture about Baudrillard's Simulacra and Simulation.
